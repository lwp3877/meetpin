Healthcheck endpoints fix deployment
Date: 2025-09-25
Issue: Route collision between /status page and /api/status API route
Solution: Moved status page to /system-status and enhanced Vercel functions configuration

Fixed endpoints:
- /api/status
- /api/healthz  
- /api/ready

This file forces Vercel to recognize all changes and invalidate cached routes.
